# Install

Some of these modules require gtk4 and some require qt to be installed for compilation.
all of the c files use gtk4 and all the c++ ones use qt.
You can use `make <widget>` to make any number of widgets and `make all` to make all of them. finaly `make install` will install all compiled widgets to `/usr/local/bin`. Widgets to choose from:
- shutdown-menu
- battery-display
- digital-clock
- quick-launcher
